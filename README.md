# ABM-Mesa
Some simple examples implemented in Mesa with visualization in Bokeh to illustrate the concepts of Agent Based Models:

## Accidental millionaire
A simple example from the gitbook:

https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/cbie/introduction-to-agent-based-modeling/details

It's a simple stochastic simulation of stock market prediction by agents and the evolution of their earnings.

## Random travel
A simple spatial model with agents performing random walks with different probabilities.

## Requirements

In order to run the notebooks you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed, as well as the following packages (version as tested on):

* numpy: 1.14.3
* Mesa: 0.8.3
